1) navigation vs replace

In React Native's navigation, `navigate` and `replace` serve different purposes when changing screens:

1. **`navigation.navigate('About')`:**  
   - **Purpose:** Pushes a new screen onto the navigation stack.
   - **Behavior:** Adds the new screen (`About`) on top of the current stack. This means you can go back to the previous screen using the back button.
   - **Use Case:** When you want to navigate to a new screen but still allow users to return to the previous screen.

2. **`navigation.replace('About')`:**  
   - **Purpose:** Replaces the current screen with a new screen.
   - **Behavior:** Removes the current screen from the stack and adds the new screen (`About`). This means you can't go back to the previous screen since it gets removed from the navigation history.
   - **Use Case:** When you want to navigate to a new screen without letting the user go back, like after a login or splash screen.

### Example Scenario:

- **`navigate`:** If you're on a "Home" screen and use `navigate` to go to an "About" screen, you can still go back to "Home" using the back button.
- **`replace`:** If you're on a "Login" screen and use `replace` to go to a "Home" screen after successful login, the "Login" screen will be removed from the stack, and pressing the back button won't take you back to the "Login" screen.

In summary, use `navigate` for regular transitions where back navigation is needed, and use `replace` when you don't want the user to go back to the previous screen.
